# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System

The main algorithms we used in developing our program are convolutional neural networks that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. We have used the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, and Scikit-learn libraries. We trained our model using CNNs and then evaluated our model by finding the accuracy of the testing data.

The dataset used for this project is the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark. This data has a total of 50,000 images each of dimension (30x30x3) where 3 represents the RGB channel. The dataset was further split into 27,446 training images, 11,763 validation images, and 12,631 test images.

The testing accuracy has come out to be 98.1% which shows that our algorithm is highly efficient and doesnâ€™t have overfitting. The details of the F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Support, and Accuracy can be seen in the Classification Report
